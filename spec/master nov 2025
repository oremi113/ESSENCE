# PART ONE: FOUNDATION

## CHAPTER 1. PRODUCT PURPOSE AND PHILOSOPHY

### 1.1 Mission

ESSENCE preserves a person's voice as a living keepsake.

Users create a **voice record** that can support future messages, memories, comforts, and moments of connection.

### 1.2 Core Promise

**Your voice is something only you can give.**

ESSENCE helps you save it so it can stay with the people you love.

### 1.3 The ESSENCE Lens

Every screen and interaction must feel:
- **Warm** Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Emotionally safe and inviting
- **Ceremonial** Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Meaningful and significant
- **Personal** Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shaped by and for the individual
- **Steady** Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Reliable and grounded
- **Safe** Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Protective of emotional and technical vulnerability
- **Emotionally aware** Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Responsive to the user's emotional state

**Core Principle:**  
The experience should feel like shaping something real and meaningful, not interacting with tech.

### 1.4 Key Metaphors

ESSENCE uses a consistent set of metaphors throughout all copy, UI, and interactions:

| Metaphor | Meaning | Application |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Voice record** | The thing you are building | Replaces "voice model" or "AI clone" |
| **Voice continuity** | Ongoing stability and depth | Describes quality improvements |
| **Artifact** | Your voice feels like a crafted object | Used in completion/celebration moments |
| **Keepsake** | Preserved gently, like a family memento | Used in protection/storage contexts |
| **Stewardship** | ESSENCE cares for your voice with intention | Used in security/preservation offers |
| **Long-term protection** | Offered after the asset is complete | Used in monetization contexts |

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Never say "AI voice" or "voice clone"
- Never say "training" (use "building your voice record")
- Never say "model quality" (use "voice continuity")
- Always use tangible, physical-feeling language

### 1.5 The Breath Stone

The Breath Stone is the anchor of the experience.

**Core Qualities:**
- Present, steady, and responsive
- Reflects emotional tone and progress
- Creates grounding, ceremonial presence
- Feels alive, not animated
- Behaves asymmetrically (never perfectly smooth)

**Stone behaviors vary by context:**
- Onboarding screens
- Recording states
- Celebration moments
- Playback experiences
- Preservation offers
- Home states (A and B)

A complete behavior table appears in Chapter 8.

### 4.5 Dynamic Personalization Logic

The following metadata fills into specific prompts:

{userName}

{city}

{date}

{time}

era variants (1950s to 2000s)

relationship variants

time of day

This yields dozens of natural variations without extra engineering overhead.

### 4.6 Progress Logic

The UI must reflect accurate progress counting:

Stage 1: 5 moments

Stage 2: 12 moments

Stage 3: 8 moments

Total: 25

Progress ring should animate subtly between prompts.
Stone should pulse warmly after each moment.

### 4.7 Emotional Pacing Requirements

The flow must:

start lightly

deepen slowly

include grounding moments

rise into warmth

resolve gently

end with gratitude and closure

This pacing is key for emotional safety and model performance.

---

## CHAPTER 5. SOFT PRESERVATION OFFER V3

(after all 25 moments and after voice processing completes)

The preservation offer is not a paywall.
It is an invitation to safeguard something meaningful.

ESSENCE must present this moment with warmth, respect, and ceremony.

This is the most sensitive copy in the entire product because it comes after the user has invested deeply and right before the emotional reveal of hearing their preserved voice.

The experience must feel like stewardship.
Not monetization.

### 5.1 Placement Logic

This offer appears directly after:

All 25 moments are captured

The system completes model training

The Breath Stone settles into a reverent glow

A short pause screen prepares the user emotionally

Then the offer screen fades in gently.

This comes before the first playback moment.

### 5.2 Purpose and Philosophy

The offer explains:

what the user has created

why it is valuable

what ESSENCE can safeguard

what is free

what protection means

what upgrading unlocks

ESSENCE must avoid fear-based language.
This is about care, not urgency.

### 5.3 Emotional Intent

The tone here should feel like:

a gentle guide

a respectful steward

a warm presence

a curator of something precious

This is not sales language.
This is caretaking language.

### 5.4 Screen Layout

**Breath Stone**
Celebrate state.
Soft warm glow.
A sense of depth.

**Top Label**
YOUR PRESERVED VOICE IS READY

**Title**
Your voice has reached full depth.

**Body**
You have shaped twenty five moments.
Your preserved voice is now steady, natural, and unmistakably yours.
It is a complete voice record, ready to be used for future messages.

**Sub body**
Here is how we can help you care for it.

**Two Cards (stacked)**

**Card A: Free Tier**

**Title**
Keep your voice as a keepsake

**Body**
Your complete voice record stays saved here.
You can create one message to hear how your voice feels when it speaks for you.

**Benefits list**
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Your voice record is stored safely
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ One message included
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ No commitment
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ You can upgrade at any time

**CTA inside card**

This simply moves to the first playback sequence.

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Future feature access
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Support whenever you need it

**Price**

**CTA**
Activate now

### 5.5 Secondary Copy (beneath cards)

Most people choose protection after hearing their voice in action.
There is no pressure.
Your voice stays safe either way.

### 5.6 Button Structure

**Primary CTA (bottom of the screen)**
Continue

This takes the user to their first playback moment.

**Secondary CTA (optional, top right)**
Maybe later

This also takes the user to playback.
The offer returns after first message creation.

### 5.7 Behavioral Logic

**If user chooses "Activate now"**

move into payment screen

after payment, skip free tier flow

go straight to ceremonial playback

Home B loads the paid version

**If user chooses "Create my first message"**

skip payment

proceed to ceremonial playback

Home B loads free tier state

after 1 free message is sent, soft upsell appears later

**If user declines everything**

proceed to playback

soft upsell returns later

### 5.8 Emotional Notes

The offer must always feel like:

"You created something meaningful.
Here is a gentle way to protect it."

Never:

"You must pay to continue."

The user has earned this moment through emotional investment.
They must never feel pushed or restricted.

This is why the first message is free.
It allows them to feel the magic before deciding on protection.

### 5.9 Stone Behavior

soft reverent glow

slow calming pulse

warm edges

depth lighting

subtle shimmer

The stone communicates:

"Your voice is ready.
Take your time."

### 5.10 Error Handling

**If payment fails**
"Something did not go through.
Your voice is safe.
Try again when you are ready."

**If user closes the screen**
They return to the playback moment.

**If internet disconnects**
"Your voice record is saved.
We will continue once you are reconnected."

### 5.11 Summary

The Soft Preservation Offer V3 must feel like:

a warm invitation

the stewardship of a keepsake

the continuation of something sacred

the natural next step in caring for your voice

This is the correct emotional and functional placement.
It is now fully aligned with your brand, your demographic, your prototype, and your long term product strategy.

---

## CHAPTER 6. FIRST PLAYBACK V2

A cinematic reveal of the user's preserved voice

The first playback moment is the emotional centerpiece of ESSENCE.
It is the moment where the user hears the continuity of their own voice held in time.
It must feel reverent, slow, and deeply personal.

The tone should be similar to:

lighting a candle

opening a keepsake box

hearing a voice message left by someone you love

This is not a tech demo.
It is a ceremony.

### 6.1 Placement and Sequence

The playback happens after:

All 25 prompts are complete

Model processing finishes

The Soft Preservation Offer V3 is shown

The user chooses to continue without upgrading or chooses free tier

A brief emotional grounding screen prepares them

### 6.2 Emotional Goals

The playback moment should create:

a small pause in the user's day

a feeling of presence

a sense of gratitude

a gentle pride in what they created

a realization that this voice can carry their words forward

This moment anchors the idea of:

voice continuity

voice stewardship

keepsake preservation

emotional insurance

### 7.7 Step Four: Generate Message

**Breath Stone**
Working state.

**Label**
PREPARING YOUR MESSAGE

**Title**
Your preserved voice is shaping your words.

**Body**
This takes a moment.
We are crafting a message that feels warm and natural for the person you chose.

**Loading Indicators**
Soft progress text:
"Finding your tone"
"Shaping your message"
"Almost ready"

**Timing**
2 to 4 seconds
Never instant, to maintain ceremonial pacing.

### 7.8 Step Five: Message Preview and Playback

This is the moment where the user hears their preserved voice speak a real message.

**Breath Stone**
Playback state
Synchronized to the voice

**Label**
YOUR MESSAGE

**Title**
Here is what your voice created.

**Message Playback Card**

Play button

Waveform

Duration

Message text shown beneath

**Actions under message**
Regenerate
Edit text
Save message

**Primary CTA**
Save and continue

**Secondary CTA**
Regenerate message

**Behavior**

Regenerate produces a new version with the same inputs

Edit text allows user to change the written script before regenerating the audio

Save stores the audio and message in their Home screen

**Emotional Intent**
This should feel magical and reassuring.
Like their voice is capable of carrying love forward.

### 7.9 Free Tier Logic Integration

Since this is the free tier's single included message:

If this is the user's first message

allow saving freely

mark one credit used

remove upgrade prompts in this flow

After saving

user returns to Home B (free tier state)

Home B presents a soft upsell later in the journey

### 7.10 Post Save Transition

After the user saves the message, show:

**Breath Stone**
Soft celebrate state.

**Label**
MESSAGE SAVED

**Title**
Your words are now part of your keepsake.

**Body**
You can create more messages anytime.
Your preserved voice is here when you need it.

**Primary CTA**
Return home

**Secondary CTA**
Make another message

This creates a gentle close to the creation experience.

### 7.11 Error Handling

**If message generation fails**
"We ran into a small issue.
Your voice is safe.
Let us try again."

**If user quits mid generation**
Return to Step One.

**If audio fails to load**
"Your message is ready, but the playback needs a moment.
Please try again."

## CHAPTER 8. BREATH STONE BEHAVIOR SYSTEM

The emotional anchor of the ESSENCE experience

The Breath Stone is the central visual and emotional element of ESSENCE.
It holds the tone of the entire product and signals:

safety

calm

presence

progress

ceremony

continuity

It should feel like a living object that breathes with the user.

This chapter outlines the full behavior system for every screen and every phase.

### 8.1 Principles of the Breath Stone

The stone must always feel:

organic

soft

warm

ceremonial

natural

responsive

never distracting

It should never feel flashy or mechanical.

The stone is not decoration.
It is a companion.

### 8.2 Stone Components

The stone has four distinct animation layers:

**Core Pulse**
The central breath-like expansion and contraction.

**Glow Layer**
A soft radial light that shifts with emotional tone.

**Surface Shimmer**
A subtle moving texture that appears in specific states.

**Edge Ripple**
Light rings that appear during important ceremonial moments.

These combine to create a feeling of presence and warmth.

### 8.3 Stone Dimensions and Units

All sizes are defined relative to a base unit called Stone Base Size.

Stone Base Size is the default size used on secondary screens.

For consistency across screens:

Stone Base Size: 100 percent

Playback Size: 130 percent

Celebrate Size: 120 percent

Working Size: 110 percent

Idle Size: 100 percent

Recording Size: 135 percent

Amplitude numbers refer to percentage of size change.

Glow percentages refer to opacity of the glow layer.

Cycle time is measured in milliseconds.

### 8.4 State Index

Below is the master list of all stone states:

Idle

### 8.8 Developer Notes

All animations must be GPU optimized

Use CSS transitions where possible

Prefer requestAnimationFrame for pulse sync

Replay waveform must drive amplitude in real time

Glow layer must be separate from main shape

Edge ripple can be SVG or canvas based

All timings adjustable for accessibility settings

### 8.9 Accessibility Considerations

Reduced motion mode: amplitude cut by 50 percent

Timer-free mode: remove countdown visuals

High contrast mode: darker stone outline

Audio synced animations should be optional

The stone should never create visual stress.

### 8.10 Summary

The Breath Stone Behavior System V4.3 is:

emotionally intelligent

visually consistent

universal across the entire product

central to the feeling of ESSENCE

critical for user trust

pacing the entire experience

This completes the full animation and behavior specification.

---

## CHAPTER 9. HOME A AND HOME B

Your central ESSENCE experience

The home screens are the main environment where users return after their first day and every day after.
They must be:

calming

ceremonial

grounding

simple

emotionally supportive

They must not feel like a productivity dashboard.
They must feel like the entrance to a personal archive.

### 9.1 Purpose of the Home Screens

The home experience must:

orient the user

reinforce their progress

frame the voice as an artifact

visually express voice continuity

encourage warm, gentle next steps

never feel like a checklist

The user should feel held, not hurried.

### 9.2 Two Home States

There are two core home environments.

**Home A**

For users who have not yet completed all 25 prompts.
These users cannot create messages yet.
Their focus is to continue shaping their voice record.

**Home B**

For users who have completed their full voice record.
These users can:

create messages

add more moments

explore their stored messages

engage with the app like a keepsake journal

Each home state is designed for a different emotional need.

### 9.3 Home A Goals

Home A must feel like:

a warm invitation

a continuation of the journey

gentle encouragement

slow progress toward something meaningful

The user should never feel behind.
It should feel like a garden they are tending, not a task list.

### 9.4 Home B Goals

Home B must feel like:

the artifact is complete

their voice is now preserved

they can use it whenever they want

they are empowered to create messages

their voice continuity is maintained

Think of it like the view after finishing a puzzle.
The stone feels infused.
The interface feels whole.

### 9.5 Home A Layout (In Progress Voice Record)

**Breath Stone**

State: Guidance
Size: 110 percent
Glow: steady warm light
Behavior: gentle guidance pulse

**Label**

YOUR VOICE RECORD

**Title**

You are shaping your voice.

**Body Copy**

Your voice record is still growing.
You have created {X} of 25 moments.
Each one helps preserve your natural tone and expression.

**Continuity Indicators**

Three vertical or horizontal markers representing the stages:

Stage One
Stage Two
Stage Three

Display State
Locked or partially filled, depending on progress.

**Primary CTA**

Continue

**Secondary CTA**

View progress

**Progress Summary Card**

Moments completed

Estimated time to finish

Next stage coming up

The progress summary must feel gentle, not like a productivity tracker.

**Hidden Elements**

The following should not appear in Home A:

create a message

message archive

history

settings related to message creation

preservation offers

The user must not be misled into thinking the voice is ready.

### 9.6 Home A Emotional Design

The environment should convey:

warmth

safety

steady progress

lack of urgency

Copy tone is:

soft

supportive

patient

**Examples**
"Your voice record is growing."
"You are adding depth with each moment."
"Continue when the moment feels right."

Nothing should imply speed or deadlines.

### 9.7 Home B Layout (Completed Voice Record)

Home B appears the moment the user finishes their full 25 moments and completes playback.

**Breath Stone**

State: Infused
Size: 115 percent
Glow: warm, stable
Effect: slow radiant presence

This visually signals that the voice is "whole."

**Label**

YOUR PRESERVED VOICE

**Title**

Your voice record is complete.

**Body Copy**

You have finished all twenty five moments.
Your voice has been shaped and preserved as a keepsake.
It is steady, natural, and ready to carry your words when you need it.

**Continuity Indicators**

All stages filled in with soft glowing markers.
A sense of completeness.

**Primary CTA**

Create a message

**Secondary CTA**

Add more moments

**Tertiary CTA**

(Note: The order is essential. Creation is the heart of the experience.)

### 9.8 Home B Secondary Elements

**Message Archive Preview**

A small carousel or list showing up to three saved messages with preview text.

**Upgrade Indicator (If on free tier)**

Soft, never pushy.
Shown as:

"Activate continuous protection to keep this voice active long term."

Not a paywall.
Not a barrier.
Optional and kind.

**Optional Card: Voice Care Tips**

Gentle suggestions like:

"Adding optional moments helps your voice stay steady over time."

### 9.9 Home B Emotional Design

Home B should feel like:

a completed keepsake

a place the user can return to

something warm and safe

The interface should feel more grounded and complete than Home A.
A subtle shift in color tone or stone glow is enough.

Copy tone is:

proud

supportive

tender

**Examples**
"Your voice is now preserved as a keepsake."
"You can create heartfelt messages anytime."
"This voice record will be here when you need it."

### 9.10 Transition from A to B

This is a meaningful moment.
Do not simply reload the home screen.

**Transition Sequence:**

CCY or Stage Three completion

Model training

Preservation offer

Playback ceremony

"Message Saved"

Fade to Home B with a soft stone glow change

The stone must visually shift from Guidance to Infused.
Indicators softly fill.
CTA changes naturally.

This transition should feel like stepping into a new chapter.

### 9.11 Home Logic Rules

**Home A Rules**

user has less than 25 moments

all actions restricted to CCY

cannot create messages

cannot trigger playback

no preservation offers

no archive

**Home B Rules**

user has all 25 moments

playback allowed

create message available

archive visible

CCY optional (for adding moments)

preservation offer appears softly if not activated

### 9.12 Developer Requirements

State detection is based on number of completed prompts

Stone state must update in sync with home screen

Continuity indicators must reflect true completion count

Home B must not appear early under any circumstance

Two separate route guards

Memory of last action for smoother transitions

### 9.13 Summary

Home A and Home B form the emotional and functional center of ESSENCE.

**Home A**
Warm guidance.
The voice is still forming.
The path is clear and gentle.

**Home B**
The voice is complete.
The user can now create, revisit, and preserve moments with confidence.

This chapter corrects the master spec, aligns with your prototype v7, and integrates the voice continuity metaphors and emotional language you want throughout the product.

## CHAPTER 10. CONTINUE CAPTURING YOUR VOICE (CCY) V3

The in-progress journey for shaping the full voice record

CCY is a guided environment that supports users who have not yet completed all twenty five moments.
It must feel gentle, warm, ceremonial, and encouraging.
Nothing should feel like a task list.
The user should feel like they are tending to something meaningful and slowly shaping an artifact that will last.

This flow appears every time a user returns before finishing all twenty five prompts.

### 10.1 Purpose of CCY

CCY exists to:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ orient the user when they return
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ gently guide them to the next moment
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ reinforce that each moment strengthens their voice record
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ create emotional continuity with the onboarding arc
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ offer small wins and micro celebrations
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ avoid friction, overwhelm, or pressure

The experience should feel like soft guidance, not a checklist.

### 10.2 CCY Entry Points

A user enters the CCY flow when:

They completed onboarding but have fewer than twenty five prompts

They tapped Continue on Home A

They left mid prompt and returned

They closed the app and returned at a later time

They open a push notification inviting them to continue shaping their voice

Each entry resumes exactly where they left off.

### 10.3 Emotional Intent

The CCY environment must communicate:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ You are safe
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ You are making progress
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ You are shaping something important
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Your voice record is growing and becoming more complete
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ You can continue whenever you are ready
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ You never have to rush

The emotional arc is soft and protective.

### 10.4 CCY Structure Overview

The CCY flow contains four micro steps:

**Reentry Orientation**
Shows where they left off and what comes next in a warm, reassuring tone.

**Warm Guidance Card**
A gentle framing that sets the emotional environment.

**Prompt Recording Screen**
The guided recording interface for the next moment.

**Micro Celebration and Progress Update**
Simple, uplifting reinforcement before moving to the next moment.

This sequence repeats until all twenty five prompts are captured.

### 10.5 CCY Screen One: Reentry Orientation

**Label**

YOUR VOICE RECORD

**Title**

You are shaping your voice.

**Body Copy**

You have created {X} of twenty five moments.
Your voice record is growing with each one.
When you are ready, continue with your next moment.

**Continuity Indicators**

Three stage markers that show:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Stage One
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Stage Two
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Stage Three

Only the current stage is active.
Completed stages have gentle filled markers.
Future stages are dim and calm.

**Breath Stone State**

Guidance
Warm glow
Soft pulse

**Primary CTA**

Continue

**Secondary CTA**

Pause for now

Pause for now returns the user to Home A, not out of the app.

**Emotional Purpose**

Reassurance and grounding.
The user feels oriented and held.

### 10.6 CCY Screen Two: Warm Guidance Card

The guidance card appears only for two seconds to set tone.

**Title**

Welcome back.

**Body Copy**

Your next voice moment is ready.
Take a breath, settle in, and continue when it feels right.

**Breath Stone State**

Guidance with a short inhale and exhale animation.

**Transition Behavior**

Automatically moves to the recording prompt after two seconds.

**Emotional Purpose**

Creates a brief ritual, reducing the feeling of a task.

### 10.7 CCY Screen Three: Prompt Recording Experience

This is the heart of CCY.
Each prompt is one brushstroke in the artifact.

**Label**

MOMENT {N} OF 25

**Title**

Your next voice moment.

**Prompt Display**

A short preview phrase is shown first:
"Describe a place where you feel calm."

Then the full script is revealed inside a card.

Scripts match your twenty five prompt sequence exactly.

**Breath Stone State**

Recording
Active rhythmic pulse
Warm core glow
Stone expands slightly when recording begins

**Interface Elements**

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Large start button
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Live waveform during recording
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Soft timer
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Pause and Stop buttons

**After Recording Controls**

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Play
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Re-record
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ This feels right

The copy avoids words like Done or Submit to maintain emotional tone.

**Emotional Purpose**

Guided, unhurried, ceremonial collection of moments.

### 10.8 CCY Micro Rewards and Encouragement

After each moment, a micro celebration appears.

**Celebration Card**

**Title**

A new moment has been added.

**Body Copy**

Your voice record just grew a little stronger.
You are now at {X} of twenty five moments.

**Breath Stone State**

Calm celebratory glow
Slow pulse with warm light shimmer

**Primary CTA**

Next moment

**Secondary CTA**

Pause for now

**Emotional Purpose**

A tiny win.
A sense of progress without pressure.

### 10.9 Stage Transition Moments

At the end of each stage, the user receives a mid journey milestone.

**Title**

Stage {StageNumber} complete.

**Body Copy**

Your voice record is gaining depth.
You have added {X} moments so far.
Continue whenever you are ready.

**Breath Stone State**

Celebrate

**Primary CTA**

Continue

**Secondary CTA**

Pause for now

Micro guidance maintains positive energy.

### 10.10 CCY Exit Logic

Users can exit CCY at several points:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Reentry Orientation
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ After any prompt
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ After any stage completion
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ After any micro celebration

When exiting, they always land in Home A with updated progress.

The user should never feel locked in.

### 10.11 Completion and Transition to Final Sequence

Once the user completes prompt twenty five:

CCY automatically moves to
"All moments captured"

Model training begins

Preservation offer appears

First playback ceremony

Transition into Home B

CCY must never appear again once all twenty five moments are complete.

### 10.12 Developer Requirements

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Must resume exactly where user left off
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Save partial recordings only after user presses Play and approves
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Stage progress must sync with Home A continuity indicators
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Stone behavior must match CCY state
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Auto transition timings must never block accessibility
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Scripts must be securely stored and rendered from a single source of truth

### 10.13 Summary

CCY V3 is now:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ warm
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ grounded
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ transparent
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ celebratory
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ emotionally protective
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ easy to continue
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ easy to pause
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ deeply aligned with voice record, voice stewardship, and artifact framing

CCY remains the emotional core of your voice insurance value.

## CHAPTER 11. SOFT PRESERVATION OFFER V3

A warm invitation to protect the voice record long term

The preservation offer appears only after the user has:

completed all twenty five prompts

reached the "All moments captured" milestone

waited through model training

heard their preserved voice during the first playback ceremony

This timing is intentional.
The user must feel proud, emotionally moved, and connected before being invited to protect their voice record.

This is not a paywall.
This is stewardship.

### 11.1 Purpose of the Preservation Offer

The soft offer must:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ frame the voice as a keepsake
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ reinforce that the voice record is valuable
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ introduce long term protection
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ avoid pressure or urgency
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ invite the user to protect something meaningful
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ still allow them to continue exploring without committing

The key principle is choice without fear.

### 11.2 Emotional Intent

The tone should feel like:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a curator speaking
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a gentle archivist
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a guide helping them protect something important

No sales energy.
Only stewardship and continuity.

### 11.3 When the Offer Appears

The offer appears immediately after:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ First Playback Moment V2 has completed
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ the user has pressed Continue after hearing their preserved voice

They must hear themselves before being asked.

### 11.4 Screen Layout and Behavior

**Label**

YOUR PRESERVED VOICE

**Title**

Keep your voice protected for the long term.

**Body Copy**

Your voice record is now complete.
You shaped twenty five moments.
Your voice has been preserved with clarity and warmth.

If you would like, we can keep your voice protected so it stays steady and accessible in the years ahead.

Most people choose to activate protection once they hear how natural their voice sounds.

**Value Framing Elements**

Under the body copy, a short list appears with soft icons:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Long term protection for your preserved voice
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Secure storage of all twenty five moments
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Priority care and rebalancing if your voice changes over time
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Access to all message creation features
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Three voice messages included instantly

These must feel like features of preservation, not a subscription list.

**Breath Stone State**

Infused
Warm steady glow
A moment of gentle presence

**Primary CTA**

Activate protection
(subtle price tag appears beneath: 4.99 per month)

**Secondary CTA**

Not now

Secondary CTA continues the flow without penalty.

### 11.5 Handling the Secondary CTA

If the user chooses Not now:

**Transition Screen**

Label: YOUR VOICE IS READY
Title: You can create messages anytime.
Body: Your three included voice messages are waiting.
CTA: Create my first message

**Important**
The voice record always remains preserved for basic access even if protection is not activated.

You are never withholding their keepsake.

### 11.6 Micro Reinforcement After Accepting

If the user activates preservation:

**Label**

VOICE PROTECTION ACTIVATED

**Title**

Your voice is now protected.

**Body**

Your preserved voice will remain secure, steady, and ready to use whenever you need it.
Your three included messages are waiting.

**CTA**

Create my first message

A small confirmation icon and soft animation appears.
The stone brightens slightly for two seconds.

### 11.7 Behavioral Logic

**If user selects "Activate protection"**

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ update their account
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ unlock long term protection flag
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ allow unlimited messages
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ route to message creation flow

**If user selects "Not now"**

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ allow access to three included messages
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ present a soft reminder card inside Home B
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ no hard blocks or restrictions

The offer should never feel like a barrier.

### 11.8 Preservation Offer Card in Home B

A light card appears at the bottom of Home B if the user has not activated protection.

**Card Copy**

Keep your voice protected
Your voice will stay steady and accessible with long term protection.

**CTA:** Activate protection

This card should feel like a quiet invitation, not an advertisement.

### 11.9 Copy and Tone Requirements

The offer uses:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ keepsake language
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ stewardship language
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ long term continuity framing
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ gentle emotional pacing
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ no pressure
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ no technical jargon

Avoid words like:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ plan
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ upgrade

Preferred terminology:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ protection
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ keep it safe
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ long term care
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ voice continuity
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ preserved voice
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ voice record
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ keepsake

### 11.10 Developer Requirements

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Offer must only unlock after Model Training and First Playback
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Do not allow message creation if the user has not heard playback yet
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ If user reopens the app after playback but before choosing, the offer must be shown again
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ If user selects Not now, system must unlock one message
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ If user activates protection, set long term protection flag
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Home B must show correct state based on protection flag

### 11.11 Summary

Soft Preservation Offer V3:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ is not a paywall
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ is not urgent
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ is not transactional

It is an invitation to protect a personal keepsake.
It is a moment of pride and care after a deeply emotional process.
It creates a natural bridge between the ceremonial journey and continued creation.

This chapter is now ready to merge into your Master Specification V4.3.

## CHAPTER 12. FIRST PLAYBACK V2

The ceremonial reveal of the preserved voice

First Playback is the most emotionally charged moment in ESSENCE.
It is the moment where the user hears their preserved voice for the first time after shaping all twenty five moments.
It must feel personal, cinematic, warm, and reverent.

This is the payoff for the entire journey.
It is the proof that their work created something real.

### 12.1 Purpose of First Playback

First Playback should:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ validate the twenty five moment journey
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ make the user feel proud
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ make the voice feel like an artifact
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ deepen trust in ESSENCE
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ create a cinematic reveal experience
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ prepare the user for the preservation offer
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ open the doorway into message creation

This is not a technical demo.
This is a keepsake unveiling.

### 12.2 When the Playback Occurs

The playback screen appears only after:

all twenty five prompts have been fully recorded

the "All moments captured" screen

the full model training sequence

the user taps Continue on the preservation offer screen

Then the stage is set for a controlled emotional moment.

### 12.3 Emotional Intent

The experience must feel like:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ listening to something sacred
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ hearing a version of yourself that you want to protect
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a peaceful reveal
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a moment that makes them pause and reflect

Tone is quiet, warm, respectful, gentle.

### 12.4 First Playback Screen Layout

**Label**

THIS IS YOUR VOICE

**Title**

Your preserved voice is ready.

**Body Copy**

Here is a first message created from the twenty five moments you shared.
It carries the natural sound, tone, and warmth of your preserved voice.

**Playback Card**

This contains:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a title: "Your preserved voice"
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a short generated message (twelve to fifteen seconds)
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a play button
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a visual waveform that responds during playback

**Generated Message Example**

"Hello. This is my voice, preserved from today. I hope it brings comfort and warmth whenever you hear it. Thank you for shaping these moments with me."

This example is for design guidance.
The actual message will be auto generated.

**Breath Stone State**

Playback
Soft inhale and exhale synced to the voice
Warm light that brightens on vowels and softens on pauses
Size: 130 percent
Glow: gentle and continuous

**Primary CTA**

Continue

No secondary CTA is needed here.
The moment must remain emotionally focused and simple.

### 12.5 Playback Behavior

**Before playback**

The card shows a ready state.
No movement except the stone.

**During playback**

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The waveform animates with peaks and valleys
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The stone breathes in sync with the message
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The play button becomes a pause button

**After playback**

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The stone returns to a steady glow
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Play resets
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ CTA remains visible

The user can replay as many times as they want.

### 12.6 Accessibility Considerations

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Screen reader readable transcript
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Optional captions under the waveform
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Subtle vibration on play for mobile
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ No auto play
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Button sizes optimized for older users

### 12.7 Transition Out of Playback

When the user presses Continue, they are guided into the next ceremony.

**Transition Screen**

Label: YOUR VOICE IS READY
Title: You can now create messages.
Body: Your preserved voice can speak on your behalf anytime you wish.
CTA: Create my first message

This prevents abruptness and maintains the emotional rhythm.

### 12.8 Playback Failure Handling

If the playback cannot generate the message:

**Fallback Copy**

"We could not create your first playback. Your twenty five moments are still preserved. We will regenerate your playback now."

User sees a brief loader and then the playback appears.

No blame or technical language is used.

### 12.9 Developer Requirements

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Requires twenty five complete moments
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Requires trained model
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Playback must stream or play locally without lag
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Must support repeat playback
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Stone must sync with audio waveform
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Must trigger event tracking: FirstPlaybackStarted and FirstPlaybackCompleted

### 12.10 Why This Works

This version of the playback flow:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ creates a moment of reverence
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ reinforces the artifact framing
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ makes the voice feel worth protecting
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ sets up long term protection naturally
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ sets a trustworthy emotional tone
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ leads organically into message creation

It is the emotional center of ESSENCE.

### 12.11 Summary

First Playback V2 is:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a ceremony
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a reveal
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a keepsake moment
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a gentle preparation for message creation
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a closing chapter to the archival journey
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ an opening chapter to using the preserved voice

This chapter is now ready to merge into your Master Specification V4.3.

## CHAPTER 13. FIRST MESSAGE CREATION FLOW V2

The first moment a user speaks through their preserved voice

After the user has shaped twenty five moments, completed playback, and either accepted or declined protection, they enter the first real use of their preserved voice.

First Message Creation is the moment the user experiences ESSENCE as a tool, not just a ceremony. It must feel warm, guided, simple, and emotionally supportive.

It is not a productivity form. It is a gentle invitation to speak to someone they care about.

### 13.1 Purpose of the First Message Flow

This flow must:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ introduce users to message creation in an easy way
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ help them choose who the message is for
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ offer gentle structure through templates
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ give them emotional confidence
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ create a message that feels personal and heartfelt
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ give a cinematic reveal of a generated message
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ reinforce trust in the preserved voice
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ set expectations for future creation

The tone is warm and caring.

### 13.2 Entry Point

After First Playback, the user sees:

**Label**
YOUR VOICE IS READY

**Title**
You can now create messages.

**CTA**
Create my first message

The user taps the CTA and enters the First Message Creation Flow.

### 13.3 Message Creation Flow Overview

The flow is divided into four soft steps:

1. Recipient selection
2. Message intention selection (template)
3. Optional personal note
4. Message generation and preview

Each step has guided copy, calming UI, and a warm emotional frame.

### 13.4 Step One: Recipient Selection

**Label**
STEP 1

**Title**
Who is this message for?

**Body Copy**
Choose someone you care about. Your preserved voice will speak directly to them.

**Recipient Categories**

These appear as soft rounded cards with icons:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Daughter
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Son
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Partner
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Friend
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Parent
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Grandchild
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Someone else

If the user chooses Someone else:

A simple input field appears:
"Who is this message for?" [Name input]

**Breath Stone State**
Guidance
Soft warm pulse

**Primary CTA**
Next

**Emotional Intent**
Choosing a person sets emotional tone. No friction. No login or heavy forms.

### 13.5 Step Two: Message Intention Selection

**Label**
STEP 2

**Title**
What kind of message would you like to create?

**Body Copy**
Choose the intention that fits the moment.

**Message Categories**

Shown as selectable cards:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Birthday
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Encouragement
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Daily reminder
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A moment of comfort
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A message for the future
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Holiday
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Just checking in

Each card has a one sentence description. For example:

Encouragement
"Send a warm word of support."

Future
"A message meant for a later moment."

These are not functional templates. They are emotional anchors.

**Breath Stone State**
Guidance
Calm presence

**Primary CTA**
Next

**Emotional Intent**
The user should feel this is easy and natural, like choosing a greeting card.

### 13.6 Step Three: Optional Personal Note

**Label**
STEP 3

**Title**
Add something personal.

**Body Copy**
You can include a short detail to guide the message. This is optional.

**Input Field**

A single line input with a soft hint:
"Write something simple, such as: 'She had a hard day' or 'Wish him strength.'"

Character limit: 200

**Secondary CTA**
Skip

**Primary CTA**
Create message

**Breath Stone State**
Guidance
Steady warmth

**Emotional Intent**
Light touch. Users should not feel forced to write anything. This step builds personalization without requiring creative effort.

### 13.7 Step Four: Message Generation

Once the user taps Create message, the screen transitions into the generation state.

**Label**
CREATING YOUR MESSAGE

**Title**
Your voice is shaping your message.

**Body Copy**
This takes a few seconds. We are preparing a message in your preserved voice.

**Breath Stone State**
Working
Confident rhythmic pulse
Warm glowing core

A short progress indicator (not a percentage) cycles through:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Shaping tone
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Preparing natural rhythm
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Adding warmth
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Almost ready

The goal is to reinforce that something real and delicate is happening.

### 13.8 Message Preview Screen

**Label**
YOUR MESSAGE

**Title**
Here is your message.

**Body Copy**
This message carries your preserved voice with natural tone and warmth.

**Playback Card**

Contains:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Recipient name
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Message intention
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Waveform visualization
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Play button
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Duration
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Transcript below for accessibility

**Actions**

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Play (primary interaction)
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Regenerate
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Edit text
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Save

**CTA Primary**
Save message

**CTA Secondary**
Generate another

**Breath Stone State**
Playback
Gentle breathing synced with audio

**Emotional Intent**
This is the second cinematic moment. This is where the user feels the value of having their preserved voice available on demand.

### 13.9 Saving the Message

When user presses Save message:

**Confirmation Card**

Label: MESSAGE SAVED
Title: Your message is ready.
Body: You can send it, save it, or return to it anytime.
CTA: Return to home

This returns them to Home B with the message added to their archive.

### 13.10 Free Tier Logic

Users who have not activated protection receive:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ one message included at no cost
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a small indicator shown in the message preview
"1 message included"

The counter is soft and gentle. Never alarming.

After using your included message, a gentle card appears after Save:

"You have used your included message. You can activate protection anytime to continue creating new ones."

CTA: Activate protection
CTA secondary: Not now

Always choice, never pressure.

### 13.11 Developer Requirements

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ All steps must save progress locally
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Message generation must allow regeneration
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Stone behavior must change per step
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Accessibility friendly layouts
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Handle slow network with friendly micro copy
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Log events like: FirstMessageCreated, FirstMessagePlayed

### 13.12 Summary

First Message Creation Flow V2 is:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ guided
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ simple
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ warm
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ ceremonial
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ emotionally matched to boomer expectations
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ future proof for template expansion
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ tightly connected to message archives
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ naturally aligned with voice continuity themes

It forms the bridge between the ceremonial shaping journey and the everyday usefulness of ESSENCE.

## CHAPTER 14. MESSAGE TEMPLATES AND PERSONALIZATION SYSTEM

The emotional logic behind every message ESSENCE creates

Message templates are the heart of how users create meaningful messages with their preserved voice.
They must feel human, warm, gentle, and grounded.
They must not feel mechanical or overly AI generated.

This system defines how templates are structured, how personalization is applied, and how messages are generated across ESSENCE.

### 14.1 Purpose of the Template System

The system must:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ help users express warmth without needing to write
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ remove creative pressure
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ produce messages that feel like natural extensions of the user
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ adapt to relationships, intentions, and emotional contexts
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ scale into future categories
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ maintain ESSENCE's emotional tone and language signature

This chapter defines the rules that make ESSENCE messages feel consistent and human.

### 14.2 Core Principles for Templates

Every template must follow the ESSENCE voice:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ warm
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ grounded
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ supportive
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ emotionally honest
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ simple language
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ gentle tone

Templates should sound like something a loving parent, partner, or friend would say.

**Avoid:**

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ stiff or overly formal language
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ dramatic language
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ overly poetic language
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ long run-on paragraphs
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ complex metaphors
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ clinical or technical terms

Templates should be easy to read aloud.
They must feel like natural speech.

### 14.3 Template Structure (Required Elements)

Each message template follows the same structure.
This creates consistency across all categories.

A template contains four parts:

**1. Opening Tone Line**

Sets warmth and emotional posture.
Examples:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "Hello, I have been thinking about you."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I wanted to send you a quick message."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I hope your day feels gentle and steady."

Short and simple.

**2. Intention Core**

This reflects the selected category:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Birthday
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Encouragement
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Comfort
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Future message
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Daily check in
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Holiday
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Just because
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Personal note category

This section carries the emotional weight.

**3. Personalized Insert (Optional)**

A small detail that uses the user's optional custom note.
For example:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I heard you had a long day."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I know you have been working hard lately."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I am proud of you for everything you are doing."

If the user wrote nothing, this part is quietly omitted.

**4. Closing Line**

A gentle, simple ending.
Examples:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "Take care of yourself."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I am always sending you strength."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "You are not alone."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I care about you."

All closings must sound like something the user could realistically say.

### 14.4 Template Categories and Emotional Goals

ESSENCE launches with seven primary categories.

Each category includes three template variants to create variety.

**14.4.1 Birthday**

Emotional goal
Warm and celebratory, never cheesy.

Example core lines:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I hope this birthday brings you peace and joy."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I wanted you to know how proud I am of you today."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "You deserve a day filled with warmth and kindness."

**14.4.2 Encouragement**

Emotional goal
Supportive, grounding, hopeful.

Example core lines:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "You are stronger than the moment you are in."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I see how hard you are trying."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "Take things one step at a time. You are doing enough."

**14.4.3 Daily Reminder**

Emotional goal
Gentle and familiar.

Example core lines:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I hope today feels light and steady for you."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "Remember to breathe and take things slowly."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "You deserve a moment of calm today."

**14.4.4 A Message for the Future**

Emotional goal
Sense of continuity and care.

Example core lines:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "If you are hearing this later, I hope you are well."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I wanted to leave this moment of warmth for you."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I hope you feel supported today."

**14.4.5 Comfort**

Emotional goal
Tender reassurance without assuming details.

Example core lines:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "Whatever you are going through, I am holding you in my thoughts."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "You are not alone."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "Please be gentle with yourself right now."

**14.4.6 Holiday**

Emotional goal
Seasonal warmth without religious or cultural assumptions.

Examples:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I hope this season brings you peace and connection."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "Thinking of you with warmth today."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "May this holiday feel restful and kind."

**14.4.7 Just Checking In**

Emotional goal
Light, friendly, low pressure.

Examples:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I wanted to say hello and let you know you crossed my mind."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "I hope things feel steady today."
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ "Sending a little warmth your way."

### 14.5 Personalization Rules

Personal notes are optional and used sensitively.

**Rules:**

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ They appear only once
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ They should never dominate the message
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ They should not repeat the user's exact text
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ They must feel naturally woven in
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ They must maintain emotional tone
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ They must not introduce assumptions

**Example**
User writes: "She had a long day yesterday."

The message might include:
"I heard yesterday was tiring for you. I hope today feels gentler."

Not
"She had a long day yesterday."

### 14.6 Relationship Personalization

Recipient category influences:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ tone
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ level of warmth
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ pronouns
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ closeness
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ pacing

For example:

**Daughter**
"Sweetheart" style gentle warmth is allowed but optional.

**Friend**
More neutral steady tone.

**Partner**
More tender emotional closeness.

**Parent**
Soft, respectful warmth.

**Grandchild**
A touch more affectionate.

**Someone else**
Neutral but warm.

This system allows natural variations without stereotypes.

### 14.7 Length and Timing Constraints

Messages must be:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ ten to thirty seconds long
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ natural speech speed
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ single paragraph
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ stable pacing
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ comfortable to listen to

Avoid anything that feels scripted or overly long.

### 14.8 Scripting Style Guide

**Use:**
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ short sentences
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ clear pauses
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ simple vocabulary
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ conversational language
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ warmth without poetic flourish

**Never use:**
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ metaphors that spark confusion
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ heavy emotional claims
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ dramatic tone
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ hard transitions
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ tech language

Always assume the listener may be older.

### 14.9 Voice Model Constraints

The templates must also support stable synthesis:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ no tongue twisters
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ no rapid shifts in tone
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ no fast lists
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ no long compound sentences
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ no complex punctuation

The model must feel consistent and natural.

### 14.10 Future Template Scaling

In future versions, additional categories can include:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Life advice
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Memory anchors
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Gratitude reflections
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Notes for difficult days
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Guided breathing
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Ritual greetings
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Messages for grandchildren
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Major milestones (graduation, wedding)

The system is designed to scale into an entire library.

### 14.11 Developer Requirements

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Templates stored in structured format (JSON)
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Relationship variants referenced by tags
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Personal note logic applied through placeholder injection
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ One template selected at random per category
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ AI can regenerate using the same logic
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ All messages validated for length
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Message generation must log selections and variations

### 14.12 Summary

The ESSENCE Message Template System V1 must feel:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ warm
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ personal
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ caring
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ simple
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ structured
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ emotionally tuned

It removes pressure, supports creativity, and matches the tone of ESSENCE as a voice stewardship platform.

---

## CHAPTER 15. MESSAGE ARCHIVE AND CONTINUITY HUB

A warm home for saved messages and voice continuity

The Message Archive and Continuity Hub is the emotional library of ESSENCE.
It is not a traditional inbox and not a file system.
It is a gentle collection of moments the user created with their preserved voice.

It must feel like a keepsake drawer or a memory box.
It must encourage calm reflection, not overwhelm.

This is the second major area of the product after Home B.

### 15.1 Purpose of the Archive

The archive exists to:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ store all saved messages created using the preserved voice
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ create a peaceful space where messages can be replayed
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ allow users to revisit memories and sentiments
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ reinforce the value of long term preservation
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ serve as the place where continuity and ongoing care features live
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ support growth into future continuity features

The archive must feel emotional, safe, and warm.

### 15.2 When the Archive Becomes Available

The Message Archive is accessible only after:

all twenty five prompts are complete

the preserved voice is created

the user has entered Home B

Before this point, no archive exists.
Home A users should not see any messaging features.

### 15.3 Archive Home Screen (Continuity Hub Overview)

**Label**

YOUR MESSAGES

**Title**

Your saved messages

**Body Copy**

Here you can revisit the messages you have created with your preserved voice.
This space is yours to explore whenever you wish.

**Breath Stone State**

Warm steady glow
Acts as an anchor, not a focal point

**Message List Structure**

Each saved message appears as a soft rounded card with:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Recipient name
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Message intention
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Short preview text
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Duration
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Creation date

The preview text is the first line of the message transcript.

**Primary CTA**

**Secondary CTA**

Add more moments

**Tertiary CTA**

Filter
(optional for V1)

Filters may include:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Recipient
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Category
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Date

This maintains simplicity while giving small control.

### 15.4 Message Card Types

There are two card states:

**1. Standard Message Card**

For any saved message.

**2. Free Tier Message Indicator (If the user has not activated protection)**

If the user is on the one message free tier, the card may show:

"Included message"

This must be shown gently.

### 15.5 Message Detail Screen

When the user taps a message card, they see the full message experience.

**Label**

MESSAGE DETAIL

**Title**

{Recipient Name}

**Body Copy**

Here is your saved message.
You can replay it or create a new one anytime.

Optional sorting:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ alphabetical
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ oldest first

Filter panel includes:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ category
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ recipient
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ length

If no messages match a filter:

**Empty State Copy**

No messages match this view.
Try adjusting your filters.

Warm and neutral.

### 15.7 Archive Empty State (Before Any Messages)

When the user first arrives at the archive after preserved voice creation:

**Label**

YOUR MESSAGES

**Title**

You have no saved messages yet.

**Body Copy**

When you create messages, they will appear here.
This space will grow with warmth and meaning over time.

**Primary CTA**

Create a message

**Breath Stone State**

Idle
Warm and inviting

This avoids pressure and keeps the experience gentle.

### 15.8 Continuity Hub Features

The Continuity Hub includes subtle features that support ongoing use and voice care.

**1. Gentle Reminders**

Small cards that appear occasionally:
"Add a new moment anytime. It helps your voice stay steady."
"Your preserved voice is doing well. No action needed."

**2. Voice Care Tips**

Examples:
"A short steady prompt every few months keeps your voice fresh."
"You can add optional moments whenever you feel inspired."

**3. Seasonal Templates (Not V1 but designed for future)**

The archive is the natural place to introduce new templates during holidays.

**4. Reflection Moments**

Small cards encouraging reflection:
"Listen back to a message you created earlier. It can bring a moment of warmth."

All optional.
Never intrusive.

### 15.9 Free Tier Logic in Archive

Users on the free one message tier will see:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a soft indicator under the header
"1 message used"
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a gentle invitation inside the archive footer
"Activate protection to continue creating new messages anytime."

Tap moves to Preservation Offer.

This must feel like quiet stewardship, not a paywall.

### 15.10 Protection Activated State

If the user activates protection:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ no message limit indicator
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ message creation is unlocked
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ a small card appears once
"Your voice is protected and ready for future messages."

Breath Stone on the archive screen uses the infused state.

### 15.11 Developer Requirements

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ archive must sync locally and server side
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ message cards must be lightweight to load
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ transcript must generate cleanly
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ playback must work with waveform sync
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ delete action must require soft confirmation
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ filter panel must be persistent
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ saved message order must be stable

Archive must always reflect up to date state.

### 15.12 Summary

The Message Archive and Continuity Hub is:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ peaceful
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ grounded
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ reflective
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ organized
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ emotionally warm
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ essential for long term engagement

It reinforces the identity of ESSENCE as a voice preservation platform rather than a productivity app.

## CHAPTER 16. EDGE CASES AND ERROR HANDLING

Graceful recovery, emotional steadiness, and technical safety

ESSENCE is deeply emotional and ceremonial.
Technical friction must never break the atmosphere.
All error handling must feel:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ gentle
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ safe
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ reassuring
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ calm
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ never blaming
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ never technical or harsh

The user should always feel supported.

Error handling should maintain the sense that ESSENCE is caring for something precious.

This chapter covers all common edge cases across onboarding, CCY, voice preservation, playback, message creation, and the archive.

### 16.1 Core Principles for Error Handling

Every error state must follow these principles:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Warm tone
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Clear instruction
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ No technical blame
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ No dramatic language
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Soft reassurance
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Easy recovery
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Minimal user anxiety

Examples of approved ESSENCE tone:

"Let us try that again."
"We can fix this together."
"Your progress is safe."
"You can continue when you are ready."

Avoid:

"Error"
"Failed"
"Something went wrong"
"Your data was not saved"
"Critical issue"
"System malfunction"

Use soft, steady alternatives.

### 16.2 Handling Recording Interruptions

**1. Low Microphone Volume**

Message:
"We are having a little trouble hearing you. Try speaking slightly closer to your device."

CTA: Try again
Secondary: Skip this moment

**2. Sudden Background Noise**

Message:
"There was a bit of noise in the background. You can redo this moment if you want."

CTA: Re-record
Secondary: Keep this version

**3. Microphone Disconnect During Recording**

Message:
"Your microphone disconnected. Your progress is safe. Reconnect and continue when you are ready."

CTA: Try again

User never loses prior moments.

### 16.3 Handling Mic Permission Issues

**Permission Denied**

Appears in onboarding or during CCY.

Message:
"We need microphone access to continue recording your voice moments. Turn it on in your browser settings and then return here."

CTA: Try again
Secondary: Use a different device

**Persistent Denial**

If three attempts fail:

Message:
"Your progress is safe. When your microphone is available, you can return to continue shaping your voice record."

CTA: Return home

### 16.4 Handling Partial Recordings

If the user stops recording mid prompt:

Message:
"You paused during this moment. You can finish it when you feel ready."

CTA: Continue
Secondary: Re-record
Third: Skip this moment

Skip jumps to next moment, but if too many are skipped, this triggers a soft nudge:

"Every moment helps shape a natural voice. You can finish skipped moments anytime."

### 16.5 Handling Upload or Save Delays

If audio takes more than six seconds to upload:

Message:
"Your moment is being saved. This can take a little longer sometimes. Thank you for your patience."

A slow, warm animation plays.
The user must feel safe.

Never show a spinner with no context.

### 16.6 Handling Model Training Issues

**1. Model Takes Longer Than Usual**

Message:
"Your preserved voice is almost complete. This step can sometimes take a little longer. We will continue preparing everything for you."

**2. Training Fails on First Attempt**

Message:
"We need a little more audio to prepare your preserved voice. Let us gather a few more moments."

CTA: Record five more prompts
Secondary: Return home

This keeps emotion warm rather than alarming.

**3. Repeat Failures (rare)**

Message:
"We are having trouble preparing your preserved voice. Your recordings are safe. Our team will assist."

CTA: Contact support
Secondary: Return home

Support should be framed as care, not escalation.

### 16.7 Handling Playback Issues

**1. Audio Will Not Play**

Message:
"We could not play your message. Let us prepare it again."

CTA: Retry
Secondary: Restart playback later

**2. Waveform Fails to Load**

Message:
"The visual display is having trouble. The audio is still ready to play."

CTA: Play audio
No technical language.

### 16.8 Handling Interrupted CCY Flow

If user closes the app or loses internet:

Message on return:
"Welcome back. Your progress is safe. Continue when you feel ready."

CTA: Continue
Secondary: Review progress

If they were mid recording, guide them to re-record rather than rescue partial audio.

### 16.9 Handling Message Generation Issues

**1. Generation Delayed**

Message:
"Your message is being shaped. This may take a moment."

Soft shimmering stone animation.

**2. Generation Failed**

Message:
"We could not create this message yet. Let us try again."

CTA: Try again
Secondary: Choose another template

**3. Regenerate Loop**

After three failures:
"Your preserved voice is steady, but this message needs a little more guidance."

CTA: Edit text
Secondary: Choose another intention

This avoids frustration.

### 16.10 Handling Message Saving Errors

**Save Delayed**

Message:
"Saving your message may take a moment."

**Save Fails**

Message:
"We were unable to save this message. You can try again anytime."

CTA: Save again
Secondary: Return home

### 16.11 Handling Archive Issues

**Archive Empty (expected)**

Already defined in Chapter 15.
No error, just a warm empty state.

**Archive Unable to Load**

Message:
"Your messages are still here, but we need a moment to load them."

CTA: Refresh view
Secondary: Return home

**Individual Message Cannot Open**

Message:
"This message is taking a little longer to open. Try again in a moment."

CTA: Try again later

### 16.12 Handling Subscription and Protection Lapses

**Protection Payment Failed**

Message:
"Your long term protection needs a quick update. Your preserved voice remains safe. Update your details when you can."

CTA: Update details
Secondary: Continue without changes

**Protection Inactive for Over 30 Days**

Message:
"Your voice is still preserved. Activate protection to continue shaping new messages."

CTA: Activate protection
Secondary: Not now

**User Ends Protection**

Message:
"You can continue listening to your existing messages. New message creation is paused until protection is active again."

Warm, neutral.
Never punitive.

### 16.13 Handling Return After Many Months

When user returns after three months of inactivity:

Greeting:
"Welcome back. Your preserved voice is safe and ready. Continue whenever it feels right."

CTA: Create a message
Secondary: Add moments

This reinforces continuity and sincerity.

### 16.14 Handling App Updates and Forced Refresh

If a feature changes or update is required:

Message:
"We updated ESSENCE with a few improvements. Your voice and your moments are safe. Please refresh to continue."

CTA: Refresh

Never mention "version", "patch", or "update number".

### 16.15 Accessibility and Recovery Requirements

All error handling must support:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ screen readers
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ large tap targets
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ slow reading speeds
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ short, clear sentences
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ friendly and non alarming tone

Older users respond strongly to gentle clarity.

### 16.16 Developer Requirements

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ All error states must be recoverable
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ No dead ends
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ All errors must save progress automatically
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ CCY must resume correctly after any interruption
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Playback must retry gracefully
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Archive must not break if message metadata fails
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ API retries must be silent and invisible
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ All errors logged with context for engineering

### 16.17 Summary

ESSENCE error handling must feel:

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ soft
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ safe
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ slow paced
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ steady
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ non technical
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ emotionally protective

Even when something fails, the user must feel that ESSENCE is caring for their voice and guiding them gently.
