Build a prototype web app called **Essynce** — a beautifully designed, emotionally-driven platform for capturing a person's voice and using AI to generate custom spoken messages in that voice.

The purpose is to preserve the essence of someone (like a father, grandparent, etc.) by training a model on their voice and later using it to create legacy audio messages (e.g., birthday wishes, life advice, bedtime stories) — even after they've passed.

### 🎯 MVP Features to Include

1. **Voice Recording with Training Script**
- Load a pre-written script of 20+ phonetically rich sentences
- Display one line at a time
- Allow user to record, re-record, and playback each line
- Show progress tracker (e.g., “5/20 lines recorded”)
- Store each clip labeled by line ID

2. **Voice Model Prep (AI Placeholder)**
- Simulate or comment placeholder for sending audio to a voice cloning API (e.g., ElevenLabs or Resemble.ai)
- Display training status: “Not submitted” → “In training” → “Ready”
- (No actual API calls needed, just simulate flow with dummy data for now)

3. **Message Creation Interface**
- Text input field: “Type what you want your voice to say”
- Submit button simulates sending to AI
- Output: placeholder audio clip and/or “Your voice would say this...” message
- Add title and save to playback library

4. **Playback Library**
- Show list of AI-generated messages
- Each item includes title, timestamp, play and delete buttons

5. **Voice Quality Feedback**
- Optional: validate mic input volume, duration, or basic waveform
- Prompt user if a clip is too short or unclear

6. **Emotionally Warm UI**
- Use soft, modern fonts (Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body)
- Gentle transitions and animations
- Warm, calm color palette (e.g., cream, soft pink, dusty blue)
- App starts with onboarding screen: *“Capture your voice. Preserve your essence.”*

7. **Local Storage**
- Use IndexedDB or localStorage to save training clips and messages (no backend yet)
- Allow user to download/export audio clips as a ZIP (optional)

8. **Profiles (Optional/Stretch Goal)**
- Let users create simple profiles (name, relation, notes)
- Helps support multi-user use (e.g., record Mom, Dad, Grandpa)

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS (or Tailwind) / JavaScript
- Use MediaRecorder API for in-browser audio capture
- Use dummy audio or open-source TTS (like ResponsiveVoice or a public MP3) as a stand-in for AI voice
- Organize code into modular files (e.g., `index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`)
- Include comments to guide where future backend/API logic should be added

This is a prototype — focus on emotional clarity, ease of use, and a beautiful interface. Treat the AI voice synthesis steps as simulated for now, but lay the groundwork for future API integration.
