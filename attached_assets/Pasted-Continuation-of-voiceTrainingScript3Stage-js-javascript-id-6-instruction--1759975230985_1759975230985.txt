No phones, no screens, just us kids running around the neighborhood. And you know what? We were perfectly happy. Those were simpler times, but they were good times. Really good times.",
          "1960s": "Growing up in the sixties, everything felt like it was changing. The music, the culture, the whole world was shifting. My parents didn't always understand it, but we felt like we were part of something bigger, you know? Looking back now, those were electric times. I'm glad I got to see it all happen.",
          "1970s": "I remember the seventies so clearly. We'd ride bikes everywhere, no helmets, no worries. We'd stay out until it got dark, and nobody really worried about it the way they do now. Different times, you know? But man, I have such good memories from back then. Wouldn't trade them for anything.",
          "1980s": "The eighties were wild. Big hair, bright colors, MTV actually playing music videos all day long. We had to wait all week to watch our favorite TV show. No streaming, no recording. If you missed it, you missed it. But somehow that made it more special, you know? We appreciated things more.",
          "1990s": "Growing up in the nineties, we were right on that edge. The internet was starting, but we still went outside and hung out in person. We'd make plans without texting, just show up at someone's house and see if they were home. Seems crazy now, but it worked. Those were good times.",
          "2000s": "Being a kid in the two thousands was different. YouTube, social media, smartphones, it was all starting to take off. My childhood looks so different from my parents'. But you know what? It's the only one I knew, and I wouldn't trade it. Every generation has their thing, and that was ours.",
          "default": "I remember when I was a kid. Summer days that felt endless, playing outside, laughing until our stomachs hurt. We didn't have much, but we had each other, and honestly? That was enough. Those simple moments, those are the memories I hold onto. Those are the ones that matter."

Honestly, I don't even want to think about it."

The world's changing faster than you realize, and the people who matter won't care about that stuff anyway. Just be yourself. Trust your instincts. It'll work out better than you think.",
          "1960s": "What would I tell my younger self? Don't worry so much about what everyone thinks. You're living through incredible times. The revolution isn't just out there in the world, it's inside you too. Trust your gut, do what feels right, and you'll be fine. Better than fine, actually.",
          "1970s": "If I could tell my younger self anything, it'd be this: Stop worrying so much about everything. Life doesn't go according to plan, and that's okay. Actually, that's more than okay. Some of the best things that happened to me were the ones I never saw coming. Just relax and trust the process.",
          "1980s": "I'd tell my younger self: Take more risks. You're young, you can afford to mess up. Don't play it so safe all the time. The biggest regrets you'll have aren't the things you did wrong, they're the things you were too scared to try. So go for it. What's the worst that could happen?",
          "1990s": "Here's what I'd tell my younger self: Stop stressing so much about the future. Technology's going to change everything, but you'll figure it out. Everyone does. Just focus on what's right in front of you, enjoy the moment, and the rest will fall into place. I promise.",
          "2000s": "If I could go back, I'd tell myself: Get off social media more. Seriously. Real life is happening around you, and the people in front of you matter way more than the people online. Don't miss out on actual moments because you're worried about posting them. Be present.",
          "default": "What would I tell my younger self? Simple. Stop worrying so much about what other people think. Life's too short for that. Do what makes you happy. Trust your gut. Follow your heart. And guess what? It's all going to work out fine. Better than you ever imagined."

It's choosing each other, over and over again, even on the days when it's not easy. The movies got it all wrong. Real love is in the everyday moments, the little things. That's where the magic actually is."
