He was terrified of ice, which is unfortunate when you're a penguin. His dream? Move to the desert and open a taco truck serving fish tacos. Ironic? Absolutely. Did he care? Not one bit!",

While all the other penguins were sliding around on their bellies, Gerald was having panic attacks. His solution? Open a taco truck in the desert. Was this reasonable? No. Was he going to do it anyway? You bet your bell bottoms he was!",

Super embarrassing for a penguin, right? So Gerald decided to chase the American dream: move to the desert and open a taco truck. His friends said he was crazy. Gerald said they were just jealous of his entrepreneurial spirit!",

Like, couldn't even look at an ice cube without hyperventilating. His master plan? Ditch Antarctica, move to Arizona, open a taco truck. His friends emailed him like 'dude, that's insane' but Gerald was already packing his bags!",
          "2000s": "Once upon a time, before TikTok ruined everything, there lived a penguin named Gerald who was absolutely terrified of ice. The other penguins made fun of him on social media, which was super toxic. So Gerald said 'you know what? I'm out.' He was gonna move to the desert and open a taco truck because spite is a powerful motivator!",

          "1960s": "My advice? Question everything, trust no one, and if someone tells you to find yourself, tell them you weren't lost in the first place. The sixties taught us to challenge authority, so I'm challenging the authority of good advice by giving you this terrible advice. You're welcome!",

          "1990s": "My nineties wisdom: If you're having a problem, ask yourself: What would a boy band do? The answer is probably harmonize and dance, which won't solve anything, but at least you'll be entertained. This is genuinely terrible advice, please don't listen to me!",
          "2000s": "Modern advice: If something's going wrong, have you tried turning yourself off and back on again? Like taking a nap? No? Well maybe you should! This is basically the tech support solution applied to life. Does it work? Sometimes! Is it real advice? Questionable!",
          "default": "Here's my advice: When you don't know what to do, just do something weird and commit to it fully. Will it help? Unclear. Will it be memorable? Absolutely! Life's too short to make sensible decisions all the time. Sometimes you gotta just wing it and hope for the best!"

We'd play outside until the streetlights came on, and if you weren't home by then, your mom would just assume you'd been adopted by a pack of neighborhood dogs. Different times! But honestly, those summer days felt endless, and I wouldn't trade those memories for anything. Even the dog adoption scares!",
          "1960s": "Growing up in the sixties, everything felt electric. The music, the culture, the way people thought the world was gonna change overnight. Did it? Kinda? Not really? But the optimism was real! We thought we could do anything. Turns out we were half right, which isn't bad for a bunch of kids who thought tie-dye was peak fashion!",
          "1970s": "The seventies were wild. We rode bikes with no helmets, drank from garden hoses, and somehow survived. Our parents would just kick us out of the house in the morning and be like 'be back by dinner or don't, we're not keeping track.' And we turned out fine! Mostly! Some of us! Anyway, good times!",
          "1980s": "Being a kid in the eighties meant everything was neon and nothing made sense. We had to rewind VHS tapes, we thought Walkmen were the peak of technology, and we genuinely believed quick sand was going to be a much bigger problem in adult life. Spoiler: it wasn't! But hey, at least we had good cartoons!",
          "1990s": "The nineties were this weird time where we had the internet but it was so slow you could make a sandwich while a webpage loaded. We still went outside and hung out without texting first, we just... showed up at people's houses! Wild, right? Simpler times, weird fashion choices, but man, those were good days!",
          "2000s": "Growing up in the two thousands meant YouTube was just getting started, everyone had a MySpace with an embarrassing song auto-playing, and we thought flip phones were the coolest thing ever. Looking back, it was chaos! But it was our chaos, you know? Every generation gets their weird thing, and ours was pretty fun!",
          "default": "When I was a kid, we didn't have all the fancy technology you do now. We had imagination and stick fighting, and we were grateful!

          "1960s": "Here's the thing they don't tell you: You don't have to have your whole life figured out. The people who acted like they did in the sixties? They were lying! Just take it one day at a time, trust yourself, and remember that everyone else is just as confused as you are!",
          "1970s": "Life lesson from the disco era: Dance like nobody's watching, but also, maybe someone IS watching so at least try not to hurt yourself. But seriously, don't take everything so seriously. Life's too short and too weird for that. Have fun with it!",
          "1980s": "Eighties wisdom: Take risks! Try new things! Will you look back and cringe at some of your choices? Absolutely! But at least you'll have stories! And isn't that better than playing it safe all the time? Your future self will thank you. Or laugh at you. Maybe both!",
          "1990s": "Nineties advice still holds up: Stop worrying so much about what other people think. Half of them aren't thinking about you at all, they're worried about what YOU think of THEM! It's a whole cycle of unnecessary anxiety! Just do your thing and be cool about it!",
          "2000s": "Modern wisdom: Put the phone down sometimes. I know, I know, you need it for everything. But real life is happening right in front of you and you're gonna miss it if you're always looking at a screen. FOMO is real, but missing actual life is worse!",
