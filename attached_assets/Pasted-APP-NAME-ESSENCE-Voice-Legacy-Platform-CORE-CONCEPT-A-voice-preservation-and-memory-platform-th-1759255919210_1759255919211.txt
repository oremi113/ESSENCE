   - Instructions: "Now read with a little more life! Show your personality."
   - "Choose what resonates with you:"
   - Three options to choose from:
     
     Option A: "📖 A Letter to My Child"
     Passage: "My dear one, There are so many things I want you to know. First, that you are loved beyond measure. Every day I spent with you was a gift I never took for granted. When life gets hard—and it will—remember that you come from a long line of people who didn't give up. You have that same strength in you. Be kind to yourself. Laugh often. Take risks. And know that wherever I am, I'm cheering you on. All my love, always."
     
     Option B: "🎉 A Celebration Memory"
     Passage: "I'll never forget the time we all gathered around that table, laughing until our sides hurt. Someone told a terrible joke—I can't even remember what it was—but we couldn't stop laughing. That's what I want you to remember about our family. We knew how to find joy in the simple things. A meal together. A stupid joke. The warmth of being surrounded by people who know you and love you anyway. Hold onto those moments. Make more of them. They're what matter most."
     
     Option C: "💪 Words of Wisdom"
     Passage: "If I could give you one piece of advice, it would be this: Don't wait for the perfect moment. It doesn't exist. I wasted too many years waiting to be ready, waiting to be sure, waiting for conditions to be just right. But life doesn't work that way. The perfect moment is the one you're in right now. Say the thing. Take the chance. Forgive the person. Book the trip. Make the call. Life is shorter than you think, and the people you love need to hear it today, not someday."

     [Serious, heartfelt:] But I also want you to know that life isn't always easy. There were times I struggled, times I felt lost. That's okay. It's part of being human.
