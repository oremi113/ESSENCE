Instruction: Talk about a place you love. Let yourself get a little nostalgic.
Line to read:

Prompt 7
Instruction: Talk about someone who's always been there for you. Get a little emotional.
Line to read:
"There's this person in my life who's always been there for me. Through the good times and the bad times, they never wavered. Never gave up on me, even when I probably gave them plenty of reasons to.

Prompt 8
Instruction: Give advice to your younger self. Be honest and real.
Line to read:

Instruction: Share a moment when you felt really proud of yourself.
Line to read:
"I remember this one time when I finally did something I'd been scared to do for years. And when it was done, when I'd actually pulled it off, I just stood there thinking, 'I did it.

Prompt 12
Instruction: Share a lesson life taught you the hard way.
Line to read:
"Life taught me something the hard way: You can't control everything. And believe me, I tried. But the more you try to force things to go your way, the more they fall apart. Sometimes you just have to let go, trust the process, and see what happens. It's scary as hell, but it's also kind of freeing. Turns out, not everything needs to be controlled."

Prompt 13
Instruction: Talk about a time you were scared but did it anyway.
Line to read:

And I learned something important that day: Being scared doesn't mean you can't do it. It just means it matters."

Prompt 14
Instruction: Say something encouraging to someone having a tough day. Really mean it.
Line to read:
"Hey, if you're having a rough day, I just want you to know something. It's okay. You don't have to be strong all the time. You don't have to have it all figured out. Just getting through today is enough. Tomorrow's a fresh start, and things will get better. I promise. You're tougher than you think you are, and you're going to be okay."

Prompt 15
Instruction: Share what you've learned about what really matters in life.
Line to read:
"Here's what I've figured out after all these years. What really matters isn't the big stuff. It's not the job title or the house or the car. It's the people. It's the moments. It's the late-night conversations, the shared meals, the inside jokes. That's what you remember. That's what makes life worth living. The rest is just noise."

Prompt 16
Instruction: Tell someone you believe in them. Sound confident and warm.
Line to read:
"Hey, I want you to know something. I believe in you. I know you're doubting yourself right now, wondering if you can do this, but I've seen what you're capable of. You're stronger than you think. You've got this. Even when it feels impossible, even when you want to give up, keep going. You're going to make it. I know you are."

Prompt 17
Instruction: Share what you've learned about love over the years.
Line to read:
"Here's what I've learned about love over the years. It's not always fireworks and grand gestures. Most of the time, it's quiet. It's showing up. It's being there when it's hard. It's choosing each other, over and over again, even on the days when it's not easy. The movies got it all wrong. Real love is in the everyday moments, the little things. That's where the magic actually is."

STAGE 3: FINAL TOUCH (8 prompts)
Prompt 18

Prompt 19
Instruction: Share a hope you have for the future. Sound optimistic.
Line to read:
"You know what I hope for? I hope we all slow down a little. Take more time to appreciate the small stuff. Spend more time with the people we love. Worry less about things that don't really matter in the end. Life's short, and we forget that sometimes. I hope we all remember to just... live. Really, truly live."

Prompt 20
Instruction: Talk about what home means to you.
Line to read:
"When I think about home, it's not really about a place. I mean, sure, I love Chicago, but home is more than that. Home is where the people are. It's that feeling when you walk in and everything just feels right. It's where you can be yourself, completely, without any masks or pretending. That's home. And I'm really lucky to have that."

Prompt 21
Instruction: Share a piece of simple wisdom. Keep it real.
Line to read:
"Here's something I wish someone had told me when I was younger. Be kind. To others, yes, but also to yourself. We're all doing the best we can with what we have. Nobody's perfect. We all mess up. And that's okay. So be patient with yourself. Give yourself the same grace you'd give to someone you love. You deserve that too."

Line to read:
"Just so you have my information: You can reach me at five-five-five, two-one-two, three-four-five-six. My address is four-twenty-seven Oak Street, apartment two-B, Chicago. And today's date is March fifteenth, two thousand twenty-five, around three-thirty in the afternoon."

Prompt 24
Instruction: Add a light moment of humor. Keep it natural.
Line to read:
"You know what always makes me laugh? When you're walking and you trip over literally nothing. Just your own feet. And then you do that quick look around to see if anyone saw. We all do it. Every single one of us. It's ridiculous, but it's human. Sometimes you just gotta laugh at yourself, you know?"

Prompt 25
Instruction: End with a heartfelt, personalized goodbye. Make it count.
Line to read:
"Alright, that's a wrap. Thank you for listening to all of this. I hope this brings you joy whenever you hear it. Remember you're loved, you're valued, and you're doing better than you think. Take care of yourself. Love you. Bye for now!"
